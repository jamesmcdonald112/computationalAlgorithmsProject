# Computational Thinking with Algorithms Project

This project demonstrates and benchmarks several sorting algorithms. It includes both a comprehensive Java implementation and a detailed report discussing time complexity, space complexity, and benchmarking results.

## Final Grade: 88%

## Project Overview
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Counting Sort.
- Benchmarking: Measure the performance of each algorithm across various array sizes.
- Report: A detailed PDF analyzing the complexity and performance of each algorithm.
